# reallySecureLoginSystem

Goal is to make the most secure loginsystem possible, while maintining "okay" user experience.

## Getting Started

1. Configure the server/update your server.
2. Create a dabase.
3. For this app, you should use a database-user, who has only read, write, insert and update priviliges. In that way, if your systemsecurity does get breached, hacker can not drop tables and delete content. You could add a seperate user for deletion.
4. run sql script to create tables.
5. implement php-files in your setup.
6. good to go.
